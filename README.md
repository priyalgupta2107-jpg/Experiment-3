# Aim of Experiment: Study of Tuple in Python

## Theory: A tuple is a built-in Python data structure created using (). 
• Elements are ordered and accessed using indexing starting from 0. 
• len() is used to find the number of elements in a tuple.
• Supports membership operators and slicing. 
• Tuples are immutable, so they cannot be modified. 
• Immutability makes tuples faster and more secure than lists.

Differences between Tuple and List 
a)Mutability →Tuple: immutable t = (1,2,3) | List: mutable l = [1,2,3].  
b)Brackets used → Tuple: () → t = (1,2) | List: [] → l = [1,2].  
c)Speed → Tuple: faster t = (1,2,3) | List: slower l = [1,2,3]
d)Memory usage → Tuple: less memory t = (1,2) | List: more memory l = [1,2] 
e)Built-in methods → Tuple: fewer methods dir(()) | List: many methods l.append(4)

## Algorithm 1: 
1.Start.   
2.Define a tuple to store marks and attendance values.     
3.Use built-in functions like sum(), len(), max(), and min() to calculate total marks, average, highest, and lowest marks.    
3.End.   

## Alogrithm 2:
1.Start.    
2.Use count() to count the number of presents ("P") in the attendance tuple.  
3.If the number of presents is greater than or equal to 1, display Present; otherwise, display Absent.   
4.Display all calculated results.   
5.Stop.  

##Conclusion: This experiment helped us understand tuples in Python and use built-in functions to solve marks and attendance problems efficiently.
